Metrics package
===============

The metrics package holds sets of model classes and algorithms that are used to
calculate and represent different software metrics.  

Purpose
=======

The purpose of the metrics package is to provide an general object model that
is used to represent a software metric. Each metric implementation use use these 
classes to represent its result, but could extend the base classes if the metric
provides additional informations.
